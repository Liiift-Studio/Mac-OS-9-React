# Product Context: Mac OS 9 UI Component Library

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Modern web developers who want to create retro-styled applications or nostalgic user experiences lack accessible, well-maintained component libraries that accurately recreate classic operating system interfaces. While CSS frameworks exist for modern design systems, there's a gap in the market for authentic vintage UI recreation, particularly for Mac OS 9's distinctive visual language.

### Target Audience
- **Retro Application Developers**: Building apps with vintage aesthetics
- **Digital Archivists**: Recreating historical software interfaces
- **Game Developers**: Creating UI for retro-themed games
- **Creative Agencies**: Designing nostalgic brand experiences
- **Educators**: Teaching UI/UX history through interactive examples

## What Problems It Solves

1. **Authentic Recreation**: Eliminates guesswork by providing pixel-accurate Mac OS 9 components based on official design specs
2. **Time Savings**: Pre-built, tested components save hundreds of development hours
3. **Consistency**: Ensures visual consistency across retro-styled projects
4. **Accessibility**: Modernizes vintage UI with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
5. **Developer Experience**: Provides TypeScript types, comprehensive docs, and React integration

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For Developers
- **Simple Installation**: `npm install @liiift-studio/mac-os9-ui`
- **Easy Integration**: Import components and styles, use immediately
- **Predictable API**: Consistent props and behavior across components
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Storybook examples for every variant
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and autocomplete

#### For End Users
- **Authentic Feel**: UI should feel like genuine Mac OS 9
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactions accessible via keyboard
- **Clear Focus States**: Visible focus indicators matching OS 9 style
- **Responsive Feedback**: Hover, active, and disabled states clearly indicated

### Key Interactions

#### Classic Mac OS 9 Behaviors
- **Bevel Effects**: Raised edges with highlight/shadow for 3D appearance
- **Button Pressing**: Clear visual feedback when buttons are clicked
- **Window Dragging**: Title bars indicate drag-ability
- **Menu Interactions**: Classic dropdown behavior with proper hover states
- **Focus Management**: Tab navigation with dotted focus rectangles

### Design Principles

1. **Fidelity Over Modernization**: When in conflict, choose authentic Mac OS 9 appearance
2. **Accessibility Without Compromise**: Add ARIA and keyboard support without altering visuals
3. **Composability**: Components should work together seamlessly
4. **Customization**: Allow theming while maintaining Mac OS 9 character
5. **Performance**: Keep bundle size minimal, optimize for real-world use

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: NPM downloads and GitHub stars
- **Visual Accuracy**: Community validation of authenticity
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Issues closed vs. opened, positive feedback
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA conformance
- **Bundle Size**: Keep total library under 50KB gzipped
